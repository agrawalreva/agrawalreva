## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Reva!

ðŸŽ“ Data Science Ã· Math @ UC San Diego  

Incessantly curious, analytical, and driven.

Experienced in Python, SQL, React, Node.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, with a strong foundation in machine learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost), cloud and DevOps (Docker, AWS, GCP, CI/CD), and data visualization (Power BI, Tableau, D3.js). 

I drive impact by building scalable systems, deploying validated ML models, and turning complex data into decisions that shape products and strategy.

Enthusiastic about building technology that lasts, using AI for good, and expanding access to knowledge. Keen to learn, keener to do.
