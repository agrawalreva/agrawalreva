## Hi, I'm Reva!

🎓 Data Science + Math @ UC San Diego  

Experienced in Python, SQL, and modern web technologies (React, Node.js, FastAPI), with expertise in relational and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, BigQuery). Skilled in machine learning and AI frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Hugging Face Transformers), cloud platforms and DevOps workflows (AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD), and advanced data visualization and analytics tools (Power BI, Tableau, D3.js, Plotly, Looker). Familiar with distributed data processing (Spark, Hadoop) and real-time data pipelines (Kafka, Airflow).

I drive impact by building scalable systems, deploying validated ML models, and turning high-dimensional multi-modal data into decisions that shape products and strategy.

Enthusiastic about building technology that lasts, using AI for good, and expanding access to knowledge. 

Keen to learn, keener to do.
